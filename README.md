## 3D Rubik's Cube Game

This project is a 3D implementation of a Rubik's Cube built using Godot Engine. The game allows users to interact with a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube by rotating it in 3D space and shuffling it into a scrambled state. Players can rotate individual faces of the cube and enjoy smooth transitions between rotations.

# Features:

- Interactive 3D Cube: Click and drag to rotate the cube.
- Smooth Face Rotation: Rotations happen with smooth transitions, making the cube feel more realistic.
- Cube Shuffling: A button to shuffle the cube to a random state, mimicking a scrambled puzzle.
- Modular Cube Faces: Each face of the cube (top, bottom, front, back, left, right) can be rotated individually.
- Customizable Cube Size: Adjust the size of each small cube piece to fit various scales.

# Technologies Used:

- Godot Engine: The game is created using the Godot Engine, utilizing its powerful 3D rendering and scene management features.
- GDScript: The game logic is written in GDScript, Godot's integrated scripting language.
